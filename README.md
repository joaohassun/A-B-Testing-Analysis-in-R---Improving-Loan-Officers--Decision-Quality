# 📈 A/B Testing Analysis – Improving Loan Officers' Decision Quality

This repository contains the R analysis code and summary report for a group project conducted in the *Advanced Data Analysis* module as part of the Master's in Business Analytics at the University of Warwick.

The project investigates whether a new computer-assisted model helps loan officers make better loan approval decisions, using A/B testing methodology to evaluate decision accuracy and behavioural impact.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Evaluate whether a new computer model reduces decision errors compared to the existing system in the loan review process.
- **Design:** A/B test involving two groups:
  - **Control:** Used the current model
  - **Treatment:** Used the new model
- **Metrics Evaluated:**
  - Change in False Negative Rate (FNR)
  - Change in False Positive Rate (FPR)
  - Decision Revision Rate

## 📊 Key Methods

- Data cleaning and filtering
- Calculation of FNR, FPR, and revision metrics per loan officer
- Welch’s t-tests for comparing groups
- Cohen’s d for effect size
- Power analysis to assess statistical sufficiency
